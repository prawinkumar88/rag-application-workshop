WORKSHOP: Gemini WITHOUT RAG (The 'Blind' Model)
============================================================
Notice: This model has NO access to your student or course database.

Try these specific questions to see it fail/hallucinate:
1. What is Alice Johnson's GPA?
2. Who is the instructor for CS101?
3. List all students enrolled in Data Science.

============================================================
Type your question (or 'exit' to quit):
============================================================

You (No RAG): What is Alice Johnson's GPA?

Assistant (Thinking without context...):
I do not have access to the personal records or private information of individuals. Additionally, "Alice Johnson" is a very common name, and GPA information is typically protected by privacy laws (such as FERPA in the United States).

If you are referring to a character in a specific book, movie, or a sample dataset from a textbook, please provide more context so I can help you find that information!

You (No RAG): exit
